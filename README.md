Placement Prediction and Analysis
This project involves analyzing placement data to identify key factors affecting placements, predicting placement probability using machine learning, and visualizing insights through an interactive dashboard.

Project Overview
Data Cleaning: Processed raw placement data using MySQL to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze patterns and trends in placement-related factors.
Machine Learning Model: Developed a Logistic Regression model to predict placement probability based on various attributes.
Dashboard: Created an interactive dashboard to visualize placement insights and predictions.
Technologies Used
SQL (MySQL): Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Scikit-Learn: Model training and evaluation.
Power BI/Tableau (if used): Dashboard creation.
Results & Insights
Identified key factors influencing placements, such as CGPA, internships, and projects.
Built a model with reasonable accuracy to predict placement probability.
Developed a dashboard to provide interactive insights into placement trends.
How to Use
Database Setup: Import the dataset into MySQL and run the cleaning scripts.
EDA & Visualization: Run the provided Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset.
Model Training & Prediction: Execute the ML script to train the model and make predictions.
Dashboard: Open the dashboard file to visualize insights.
